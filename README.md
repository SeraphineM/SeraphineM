- ðŸ‘‹ I am a Lecturer in Political Science (Research Methods) at the University of Melbourne. [Check out my website for more information](https://sites.google.com/view/seraphinemaerz/about).

- ðŸ”­ My research interests are the study of democracy, authoritarianism, political communication, Internet politics, Central
Asia, qualitative and quantitative methods, and computational methods.

- ðŸ’¬ I maintain public git repositories which provide data (applications) on democracy [(the vdemdata R package)](https://github.com/vdeminstitute/vdemdata), democratization and autocratization episodes [(the ERT R package)](https://github.com/vdeminstitute/ERT), and a "Work-in-Progress" R package for automated data collection and analysis [(audacola)](https://github.com/SeraphineM/audacola).

- ðŸŒ± I also use git for code, data and information exchange in several other collaborative projects (for now, private repositories). 

- ðŸ¤” I wish git would allow for a âœ¨simultaneousâœ¨, collaborative editing of .md files (e.g., as Overleaf for .tex files)!
